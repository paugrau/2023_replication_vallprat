Variables (Table A2 from paper):

Farm labourers		Importance of farm labourers over the active agricultural population.
Literacy		Percentage of population able to read and write. It also distinguishes between male and female literacy.
Schools			Number of public schools, relativised by the schooling-age population (per thousand), taken from Madoz (1850). Schools are classified depending on the gender of students (mixed, boys’ and girls’) and the type of school (complete and incomplete). The source does not provide information on all the partidos judiciales.
Schooling enrolment	Percentage of students enrolled in primary education over the schooling-age population (6–15). It is also computed for boys and girls separately.
Teachers		Number of teachers over the schooling-age population (per thousand).
Urbanisation		Percentage of population living in towns larger than 10,000 individuals.
Industrialisation	Percentage of the active population working in manufacturing.
Population density	Total population divided by district area.
Population aged < 16	Percentage of population younger than 16 over the active population.
Settlement pattern	Settlements per 100 km2. Settlements are Ciudades, villas, lugares, aldeas and caseríos taken from the 1860 Nomenclator.
Family type		Number of female adults (aged 26–80) per household.
Commons			Fraction of common lands over the total district area. Taken from the Catálogo de Montes Públicos (1860).
Priests			Percentage of priests over the active population.
Non-Spanish language	Dummy variable taking the value of 1 in those districts where an alternative language to Spanish was spoken (in the district capital).
Distance to big cities	Distance from the district centroid to the nearest city bigger than 100,000 inhabitants (in km). Four cities fulfil that criterion: Madrid, Barcelona, Seville and Valencia.
Distance to provincial capital	Distance from the district geographical centre to the provincial capital (km).
Distance to coast	Distance is computed from the district geographical centre (centroid) to the nearest coastline (in km).
Aridity index		Average rainfall divided by average temperature. The climate information refers average temperature and average rainfall during the period 1950–2000. The WorldClim 1 km digital data can be found in Hijmans et al. (2005) (http://www.worldclim.org/).
Altitude		Median altitude in each district using the SRTM 90-m resolution digital elevation data (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org).
Ruggedness		Standard deviation of altitude.
District area		District area (km2).
